- Subgraph for Repo ingest process, so that ingest can happen when any tool endpoint is called, or once, then shared. optional parameter `{"repository_ingest_id: ObjectId}` could be sent into endpoints, then run the ingest process if it doesn't exist
- Testing - Testing agent can reuse the LangGraph flow developed for the Documentation agent
- Potentially we could replace the current code checking tool with the enhanced LangGraph version
- Support an array of repositories to analyse a group of repositories as a singular system.
